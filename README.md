# Example of backpackified parser

Instead of parameterizing the main parser type and adding constraints to
functions and instance declarations, the package is parameterized as a whole.

Requires [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/nix-local-build-overview.html) >= 2.0.

Build with `cabal new-build`.
